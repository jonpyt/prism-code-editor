Since this library is using a textarea element under the hood, it's trivial to use the editor in forms. The [`PrismEditor{:js}`](/api-reference/index/i-prismeditor#textarea) object exposes the editor's textarea through its `textarea` property, so all you need to do is to add a `name` attribute to it. Ideally, you'd also add an `id` to it to bind a `<label>{:html}` element to the editor. [Working example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-pk9ud7?file=src%2Fmain.ts).

The web components can also be used in forms, just add a `name` attribute to the custom element. However, they don't support validation attributes such as `required`, `minlength`, etc. The web components are therefore not always ideal in forms.

The setups won't work in forms at all since the shadow root doesn't expose the textarea element to the form.

## Adding reset support

If you want to add a reset button to your form, it won't work by default. You need to set the `defaultValue` property on the textarea and add a `reset` event listener that sets the editor's value to the initial value. Try it below:
